# pause

The goal of pause is to fascilitate the processing of your data while maintaining the 'tidy' pipeing structure. By using the "pause" pipe, `%||%`, you stop the evaluation of a pipe and can start performing the next pipe. This keeps you from having to either create a temporary variable, or pipe-within-a-pipe.
