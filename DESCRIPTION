        given = "Ellis",

Description:The magrittr package opened up the possibility to creating easily 
    read threads of thought using the pipe mechanism. This has revolutionized the 
    R community, and led to the development of the family of packages commonly 
    known as the tidyverse.
        However, this piping mechanism only allows single threads of thought, and 
    promotes the use of temporary objects littering your workspace. It also causes
    temporary objects being defined before the piped statement, which can confuse
    things.
        The Pause package circumvents this by allowing you to literally pause the
    evaluation and start another thread - what would have been the temporary object(s), 
    and pipe the entire statement into a function that would have taken your 
    temporary object.
